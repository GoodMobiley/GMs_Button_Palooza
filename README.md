# GoodMobiley's Button Palooza

This Arduino library allows you to get separate inputs from multiple buttons using one analog pin.
I don't recommend using this method to read buttons unless you absolutely must.  The consistency isn't too great.

### The compatible schematic for the Button class is in the image below

Note: Garbage in garbage out.  The better your connections the better the result so solder your splices and all that good stuff.
